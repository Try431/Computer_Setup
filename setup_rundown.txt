General
-------
- make sure /usr/share/xsessions/ has an `i3.desktop` file
- add the secondary drive to fstab (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab)
	- Example: `UUID=AKSJDKAJSHDLJJLSKD /media/isaac/Data ntfs auto 0 2`
- make sure all scripts moved over are executable
	-- can make something executable with `chmod +x`
- remove desktop window from nautlius with "gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false" (not necessary with 18.04 LTS)
- create ~/rangerdir file and add following alias to ~/.bashrc: `alias ranger='ranger --choosedir=$HOME/rangerdir;cd $(cat $HOME/rangerdir)'`
- be sure to place dmenu_cache in /usr/local/bin (and make executable!)
- make sure any scripts are placed in $PATH, or added to $PATH in `~/.profile`
- backgrounds are at http://positrondream.com/wallpapers
- Set lid closing to do nothing: http://tipsonubuntu.com/2018/04/28/change-lid-close-action-ubuntu-18-04-lts/ (in /etc/systemd/logind.conf)
- edit /etc/crontab (as root) and throw in the transmission_vpn_drop script # using qbittorrent now, not necessary
- Install displaylink drivers for displayport (https://www.displaylink.com/downloads/ubuntu)
- Run `timedatectl set-local-rtc 1 --adjust-system-clock` to fix Windows 10 time always being wrong after Linux login (http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2016/05/time-differences-ubuntu-1604-windows-10/)
- Uncheck "Turn on fast startup" in Windows 10 power options to stop "read-only filesystem" crap (https://askubuntu.com/questions/917695/read-only-partition-dual-boot-win10/917702#917702)
* Mostly work-related below *
- Do a fresh install of vscode (remove ~/.vscode and ~/.config/Code), but keep track of which extensions are currently installed
- Do a fresh install of Go (https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-easiest-way-to-update-Go-programming-language-to-the-latest-version-in-Linux)

Git Setup
---------
- http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa16/getting-started/#config-git
	`git config --global user.name "Isaac Garza"`
	`git config --global user.email garzai@alum.mit.edu`
	`git config --global core.editor nano`
	`git config --global color.branch auto`
	`git config --global color.diff auto`
	`git config --global color.interactive auto`
	`git config --global color.status auto`
	`git config --global color.grep auto`
	`git config --global alias.lol "log --graph --oneline --decorate --color --all"`


Fonts
-----
- `sudo apt install fonts-font-awesome` will get most icons, but you will need to go to fontawesome.com and download the newest package. 
-- AS OF 08/2019 --
- save new .otf files at /usr/share/fonts/opentype/font-awesome/
- reload font cache with `sudo fc-cache -f -v` or login/logout

-- OLDER METHOD --
- save new .otf files at /usr/share/fonts/opentype/font-awesome/
- save new .eot, .svg, .ttf, .woff, .woof2 files in /usr/share/fonts-font-awesome/fonts
- reload font cache with `sudo fc-cache -f -v`

- if polybar icons aren't working, be sure the fonts listed in the polybar config include the following:
	font-n = "Font Awesome 5 Free:style=Regular:pixelsize=10;1"
	font-n+1 = "Font Awesome 5 Free:style=Solid:pixelsize=10;1"
	font-n+2 = "Font Awesome 5 Brands:pixelsize=10;1"


Polybar
-------
- `wireless-tools` MUST BE INSTALLED before compiling polybar!
- https://github.com/polybar/polybar
- Dependencies: https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/Compiling
** OUTDATED **
- To get `libxcb-xrm-dev`, you need to add the ppa for it:
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:aguignard/ppa
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install xcb-util-xrm
** OUTDATED **
- Config file is in polybar directory, as is launch.sh (don't forget this, and make it executable!)
- To DEBUG issues, run `polybar <bar_name>` after setting up, and take a look at the different error messages
	-- your bar_name is whatever is in your polybar config file in the format "[bar/bar_name]" -- by default, it will be "example" if you use the example config (https://github.com/polybar/polybar#configuration)
- If brightness section isn't showing, make sure config reflects `/sys/class/backlight/...`
- If wifi section isn't showing, be sure to match the interface name using `ifconfig`
	-- e.g., in the [module/wired-network] section of my Polybar config, interface = enp59s0 because that's what shows when I run `ifconfig`.
	-- Generally, wireless interfaces start with "w" (e.g., wl01) and wired interfaces start with "e"
- If battery section isn't showing, try in/decrementing the BATX number (e.g., battery = BAT0 might need to be battery = BAT1 or battery = BAT2)
- Be sure to change filesystem2's mount point
- Change icon size with `tray-maxsize = n` in [bar/bar_name] section


Cava
----
- https://github.com/karlstav/cava
- Be sure to install automake, libtool, and git before proceeding
- Config file is in cava directory


i3-gaps

Brightness Up/Down
------------------
* Note this is only if your Fn+Up key combos, or whatever they happen to be on your computer, don't actually work *
- files to change brightness are in `/sys/class/...`
- acpi scripts should be stored in `/etc/acpi/...`
- https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/322814/xf86monbrightnessup-xf86monbrightnessdown-special-keys-not-working/427572#427572


Keyboard Backlight Up/Down
--------------------------
* Same as above, I only had to do this with a laptop whose keyboard backlight keys just weren't working -- luckily, with my current computer, I didn't have to deal with this shit *
- Create scripts similar to the ones for Brightness Up/Down, or
- If you want to bind the script to a non-ACPI key via bindsym, you can create scripts in `/usr/local/bin`. To run them via sudo without requiring a password, edit /etc/sudoers.tmp with `sudo visudo`, and add the following right above the "#includedir..." line:
	`isaac ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/keyboard_up, /usr/local/bin/keyboard_down`
- then just bind the key like:
	`exec sudo /usr/...`
